  Mattermost is secure workplace messaging from behind your firewall.

  - Discuss topics in private groups, one-to-one or team-wide
  - Easily share and view image files
  - Connect in-house systems with webhooks and Slack-compatible integrations

  For technical and operations teams who execute high-stakes, collaborative workflows,
  Mattermost provides integrated team messaging, audio and screen share, workflow automation
  and project management. Governments, banks and tech giants use our secure collaboration platform
  to reduce risk and error rates while accelerating technical productivity.
